# HackersCardgame (v 3.0.1)
Normal Tarot lacks Technology, Method and Algorithm Cards. HackersCardgame are less Tarot Cards with magical power but more cards to learn & teach & explain people one can do with modern technology today.

#### ***You should not play any card of normal tarot nor HackersCardgame***. For example if you would play "The Tower" from a normal Tarot, you would probably win against the Crown, but you would also kill an innocent couple. This would mean that you then are a murderer and responsible for the death of two innocent people and therefore checkmate

Today this would be logged in NSA/CIA DataRetention and of course also in other BigData Systems and you could then be blackmailed with that murder the rest of your life. If you though play remember always to also play the **Reversibility Card** so in case something goes wrong nobody dies and the mistake can be reverted, which technically would mean **that eg. a medic is around the person you attack** that would in case of something goes wrong or you did wrong he could prevent that.

Since i'm permanently under electronical- / psychological warfare **i can not check, if someone injected malware**, for example 0-day exploits in the jpg's or inkscape exploits in the svg's. And there are a lot of typos, partitially because i'm bad in language things but also because of the permanent terror against me

I tried to use free content, eg cc0, if i violated any licenses please create an issue in this repository to clame your license so that i can remove the file.

Please also respect my or our license. The cards are only for people that are younger that 1977.

Since this are learning cards you should print them out (./pdf/EN/A4/*) and cut them out. It will take about 1 Minute per card (400 Cards ~= 8h), what would be good for the learning curve.

further, if you find typos or mistake don't hesitate to clone this repository and send a pull request.
